A good product for the price... Its made only for Indian sim which was not mentioned in the product description. That is a major flaw as far as I am concerned.

Has good battery backup .
Good bundled software from Samsung.

My two cents is to restart the mobile regularly and clean up the cache. It would work trouble free for a long run.

Those who are having problem with touch screen, pleasego through the following instructions
1) Go-to " Language and input" section in Settings.
2) Scroll to the very bottom of these settings and tap "pointer speed".
3) by default it was 50% , so increase the slider to make the touch screen more sensitive and easier to tab.
