## Problem Description
1. Which sports have got more medals to US in 2016 than 2012?
2. Which sports have got fewer medals to US in 2016 than 2012?

## Approach
Web Scraping is done on wikipedia to extract the data. I have used pair wise plot to easily compare the medals of 2012 and 2016. The Stacked bar is used to denote the number of gold, silver and bronze medals in each sport. Swimming, Gymnastics, Cycling, Boxing, Archery and Fencing are the sports in which more medals were won by the US in 2016 when compared to 2012. Shooting, Tennis, Wrestling, Diving, Rowing and Taekwondo are the sports in which fewer medals were won by the US in 2016 when compared to 2012.
